# Sites Selected Admin client-side web part

## Summary

This is a sample SharePoint Framework client-side web part built using react.

The web part lets you manage your Azure AD applications that have the Sites Selected Api permission. With this web part you'll get an UI for managing what app can connect to which site.

The web part uses the built in MSGraphClient and needs to be approved in API management. The app asks for Microsoft Graph `Application.Read.All` and `Sites.FullControl.All`. Users of the web part will need to have Site Collection Administrator privileges to the sites being added to an app.
