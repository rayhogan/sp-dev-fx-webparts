    Thank you for your issue. It looks like the web part sample you're trying to use is not compatible with the version of Node.js that you're running in your environment.
    
    
    Please refer to the [SPFx Compatibility Matrix](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/compatibility) to make sure that you're using a version of Node.js that is compatible with the version of SPFx the sample uses.
    
    
    We'll close this issue, but if you run into further issues after you have made changes to your environment, please do not hesitate to open a new issue so we can help you further.
